    <head>FIRST READING: PROVERBS 8: 22-31</head><br><br>
22 The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his ways, before he made any thing from the beginning.<br>
23 I was set up from eternity, and of old before the earth was made.<br>
24 The depths were not as yet, and I was already conceived. neither had the fountains of waters as yet sprung out:<br>
25 The mountains with their huge bulk had not as yet been established: before the hills I was brought forth:<br>
26 He had not yet made the earth, nor the rivers, nor the poles of the world.<br>
27 When he prepared the heavens, I was present: when with a certain law and compass he enclosed the depths:<br>
28 When he established the sky above, and poised the fountains of waters:<br>
29 When he compassed the sea with its bounds, and set a law to the waters that they should not pass their limits: when be balanced the foundations of the earth;<br>
30 I was with him forming all things: and was delighted every day, playing before him at all times;<br>
31 Playing in the world: and my delights were to be with the children of men.</p>
