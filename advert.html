    <head>First Reading: Jeremiah 38: 4-6, 8-10</head><br><br>
4 And the princes said to the king: We beseech thee that this man may be put to death: for on purpose he weakeneth the hands of the men of war, that remain in this city, and the hands of the people, speaking to them according to these words: for this man seeketh not peace to this people, but evil.<br>
5 And king Sedecias said: Behold he is in your hands: for it is not lawful for the king to deny you any thing.<br>
6 Then they took Jeremias and cast him into the dungeon of Melchias the son of Amelech, which was in the entry of the prison: and they let down Jeremias by ropes into the dungeon, wherein there was no water, but mire. And Jeremias sunk into the mire.<br>
8 And Abdemelech went out of the kingâ€™s house, and spoke to the king, saying:<br>
9 My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done against Jeremias the prophet, casting him into the dungeon to die there with hunger, for there is no more bread in the city.<br>
10 Then the king commanded Abdemelech the Ethiopian, saying: Take from hence thirty men with thee, and draw up Jeremias the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.<br>

    <head>First Reading: Responsorial Psalm: Psalms 40: 2, 3, 4, 18</head><br><br>
R. (14b) Lord, come to my aid!<br>
2 With expectation I have waited for the Lord, and he was attentive to me.<br>
R. Lord, come to my aid!<br>
3 And he heard my prayers, and brought me out of the pit of misery and the mire of dregs. And he set my feet upon a rock, and directed my steps.<br>
R. Lord, come to my aid!<br>
4 And he put a new canticle into my mouth, a song to our God. Many shall see, and shall fear: and they shall hope in the Lord.<br>
R. Lord, come to my aid!<br>
18 But I am a beggar and poor: the Lord is careful for me. Thou art my helper and my protector: O my God, be not slack.<br>
R. Lord, come to my aid!<br>
