    <strong>First Reading: Jeremiah 38: 4-6, 8-10</strong><br><br>
    4 And the princes said to the king: We beseech thee that this man may be put to death: for on purpose he weakeneth the hands of the men of war, that remain in this city, and the hands of the people, speaking to them according to these words: for this man seeketh not peace to this people, but evil.<br>
    5 And king Sedecias said: Behold he is in your hands: for it is not lawful for the king to deny you any thing.<br>
    6 Then they took Jeremias and cast him into the dungeon of Melchias the son of Amelech, which was in the entry of the prison: and they let down Jeremias by ropes into the dungeon, wherein there was no water, but mire. And Jeremias sunk into the mire.<br>
    8 And Abdemelech went out of the kingâ€™s house, and spoke to the king, saying:<br>
    9 My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done against Jeremias the prophet, casting him into the dungeon to die there with hunger, for there is no more bread in the city.<br>
    10 Then the king commanded Abdemelech the Ethiopian, saying: Take from hence thirty men with thee, and draw up Jeremias the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.<br><br>

         <strong> Responsorial Psalm Psalm 40:2, 3, 4, 18</strong><br><br>
R. (14b)  Lord, come to my aid!<br>
I have waited, waited for the LORD, and he stooped toward me.<br>
R. Lord, come to my aid!<br>
The LORD heard my cry.<br>
He drew me out of the pit of destruction, out of the mud of the swamp;<br>
he set my feet upon a crag; he made firm my steps.<br>
R. Lord, come to my aid!<br>
And he put a new song into my mouth, a hymn to our God.<br>
Many shall look on in awe and trust in the LORD.<br><br>
R. Lord, come to my aid!<br><br>
Though I am afflicted and poor, yet the LORD thinks of me.<br>
You are my help and my deliverer; O my God, hold not back!<br><br>
R. Lord, come to my aid!
